TrueMeter API (Backend)

Buying a used car is risky. This API helps buyers protect themselves by using Artificial Intelligence to spot "too good to be true" mileage.

This project was born from personal experience with odometer fraud. It uses a sophisticated Machine Learning model (trained on German market data) to analyze a car's age, price, fuel type, and model to determine if the odometer has likely been tampered with.

Built with: Python, FastAPI, XGBoost, and Docker.
